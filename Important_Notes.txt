The arm has 3 main modes, 2 of which are autonomous and one manual:
	- Manual Arm movements
	- Automated box pickup
	- Automated box dropoff
The above modes can be selected with a knob on the controller by rotating it to the appropriate position.


*****************************************Manual Mode****************************************************
The manual mode has control over 4 servos within the arm system:
	- Servo 1 controls the first arm segment
	- Servo 2 controls the second arm segment
	- Servo 3 controls the claw
	- Servo 4 controls the angular position of the arm

To move within the manual mode, one of the joysticks is moved outside the defined deadzone.  This will result in the servo
constantly being incremented moving the desired part of the arm.


*****************************************Automated Box Pickup********************************************
The pickup mode is responsible for grabbing the box and putting it to the appropriate box holder.

The inputs which influence the pickup mode are:
	- Deadman joystick
	- Box selector

The deadman joystick is held outside of the deadzone to activate the sequences of the arm to pickup the box.
If the deadman joystick is let go of and the arm does not have the box yet or dropped it off, it will 
return to the neutral retracted position (exception 2 seconds before box is picked up, it will pause).  
If the box is picked up and the deadman joystick is let go of, the arm will pause in place.

The box selector is used to select which holder to drop off the current box to.  The box selector will only
change the target location for the arm if it is selected BEFORE the arm extends out to drop off a box in
its specified holder.

Manual control can be used before picking up the box incase the automated mode does not line up.
To do this, wait until the arm finishes moving into the extended position with the claw open.  It will
then pause for a 2 second period before closing the claws on the box.  Within the two second time interval,
if manual mode is required the following should be done:
	- Wait for arm to extend with claw open
	- Once arm pauses, release deadman joystick and keep it RELEASED when switching between modes
	- Switch to manual mode and apply desired corrections
	- Switch back to the pickup mode while *ahem* NOT holding the joystick
	- Once switched into pickup mode, only then move the deadman joystick to have the claw close
	  around the box and proceed with execution of the steps

If an undesired box is picked up by the arm, the user can switch to the dropoff mode any time during
the execution and the arm will reverse its steps to place the box at the starting position.


*****************************************Automated Box Dropoff********************************************
The dropoff mode is responsible for grabbing the box from the appropriate box holder and dropping
it off on the ground *gently* in front of the drone.

The inputs which influence the dropoff mode are:
	- Deadman joystick
	- Box selector

The deadman joystick is held outside of the deadzone to activate the sequences of the arm to dropoff the box.
If the deadman joystick is let go of and the arm does not have the box yet or dropped it off, it will 
return to the neutral retracted position (exception: 2 seconds before box is dropped off, it will pause).  
If the box is picked up and the deadman joystick is let go of, the arm will pause in place.

The box selector is used to select which holder to pickup a box from.  The box selector will only
change the target location for the arm if it is selected BEFORE the arm extends out to pickup a box from
its specified holder.

Manual control can be used before dropping off the box incase the automated mode does not line up.
To do this, wait until the arm finishes moving into the extended position with the claw closed.  It will
then pause for a 2 second period before opening the claws releasing the box.  Within the two second time interval,
if manual mode is required the following should be done:
	- Wait for arm to extend with claw closed
	- Once arm pauses, release deadman joystick and keep it RELEASED when switching between modes
	- Switch to manual mode and apply desired corrections
	- Switch back to the dropoff mode while *ahem* NOT holding the joystick
	- Once switched into dropoff mode, only then move the deadman joystick to have the claw open
	  releasing the box and proceed with execution of the steps

If an undesired box is picked up by the arm, the user can switch to the pickup mode any time during
the execution and the arm will reverse its steps to place the box at the desired holder.
